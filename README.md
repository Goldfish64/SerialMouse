# SerialMouse
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Goldfish64/SerialMouse/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Goldfish64/SerialMouse/actions)

Open source kernel extension for macOS enabling serial mice that use the Microsoft Serial Mouse protocol.

### Usage
Mice need to be connected before the OS is booted or they will not be detected. There is no hotplug support for obvious reasons.

### Downloads
Available on the [releases](https://github.com/Goldfish64/SerialMouse/releases) page.
